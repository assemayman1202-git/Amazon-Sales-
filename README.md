This Excel-based dashboard analyzes 100,000 Amazon orders from 43,233 unique customers across 2020-2024, revealing critical patterns in revenue performance, customer retention, and operational efficiency through interactive pivot tables, slicers, and visualizations.

Key Performance Metrics: Total revenue of $91.02M with 99.12% recognition rate, total sales amount of $91.83M, average revenue per customer of $918.26, $6.85M in taxes (7.46%), $740.67K in shipping costs (0.81%), and minimal discounts of $7,422. The analysis covers 50 products across 6 categories, 13 brands, and 21 U.S. cities.

Interactive Features: Year slicer (2020-2024), category and brand filters, payment method selector, and month filter enable dynamic analysis across multiple dimensions for actionable decision-making.

Customer Intelligence: The dashboard tracks 100,000 total orders from 43,233 unique customers with a true repeat customer rate of 61.35% (26,527 customers).

Retention improved dramatically from 33% in 2021 to 80% in 2024—a 247% improvement demonstrating exceptional loyalty growth driven by better product quality, improved customer service, and effective loyalty programs. However, 38.65% remain one-time customers (16,706), representing a $7.67M recovery opportunity.

Revenue Drivers: Electronics dominates with 55% of revenue ($50M), followed by Home & Kitchen (15.4%). 
Top products include
•	Memory Card 128GB ($1.94M)
•	LED Desk Lamp ($1.93M)
•	Mechanical Keyboard ($1.89M)
Leading brands 
•	Apex ($20M+) 
•	Urban Style ($18M+)
•	Home Ease ($16M+)
All drive significant sales.

Geographic Performance: Texas leads with $22.67M (24.7% of revenue).

Operational Insights: Payment preferences show Credit Card (34.98%), Net Banking (20.19%), and Debit Card (19.29%) as top methods.

Delivery status reveals 74.63% successfully delivered, but a concerning 15.19% return rate (above 8-10% industry benchmark) costing $13.94M at risk, likely due to product quality issues, incorrect descriptions, and size/fit problems in Clothing. Sales peak on Mondays ($13.3M) with February consistently showing the lowest monthly revenue (~$6.9M vs $7.59M average), representing a $690K monthly gap ($3.45M over 5 years) caused by post-holiday spending fatigue, shortest month effect, seasonal product mismatch, and underutilized Valentine's Day opportunity.

Critical Challenges & Root Causes:
•	One-Time Customer Problem: 16,706 customers never returned due to low first purchase value (<$50), one-time-use products (Books), and recent 2024 customers needing nurturing
•	February Revenue Decline: Post-holiday fatigue, 7-10% fewer shopping days, winter-to-spring product gap, and lack of shopping occasions
•	Electronics Over-Concentration: 55% dependency creates vulnerability to market downturns and single-category risk

Strategic Recommendations:
Immediate Actions (0-3 Months):
1.	Address February Gap: Launch February Flash Sale (20% off Electronics), Valentine's Day gift guides targeting tech lovers, and "We Miss You" campaign for Dec/Jan customers—Expected recovery: $350K+ in February revenue
2.	Win Back One-Time Customers: Three-tiered approach targeting recent 2024 buyers (15% recovery = $688K), low-value customers with 25% off + free shipping (10% recovery = $615K), and Books buyers with monthly newsletters (5% recovery = $229K)—Total potential: $1.53M annually
3.	Optimize Top 10 Products: Never stock out Memory Card 128GB, bundle complementary products (Memory Card + Card Reader), and implement upselling at checkout—Expected impact: +5% AOV = +$4.55M annually
   
Short-Term Actions (3-6 Months): 

5. Category Expansion: Add 15-20 smart home products in Electronics, revitalize Home & Kitchen with trending items (air fryers), expand activewear in Clothing, and grow Sports & Outdoors with camping gear—reduces single-category dependency risk
6. Reduce Return Rate: Conduct root cause analysis by category, improve size charts and product photos for Clothing, enhance packaging for fragile items, and implement pre-shipment quality inspections—Target: reduce to 10%, saving $4.7M annually
 
Long-Term Actions (6-12 Months):

7. Geographic Expansion: Target Texas with state-specific campaigns (+$10M), Florida with seasonal product focus (+$5M), and New York with premium product lines (+$8M)—Expected total: +$23M from geographic expansion
8. International Development: Focus Year 1 on UK market with localized descriptions and faster delivery partnerships
